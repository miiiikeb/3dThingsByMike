# 12V Socket Surround – Surface Mount

A low-profile mounting surround for standard 12V automotive sockets, designed for surface installation where flush mounting isn’t possible or desired. Available in **single** and **double** socket versions. Designed entirely in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) and built with the **BOSL2** standard libraries.
