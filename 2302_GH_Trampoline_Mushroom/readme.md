# Catamaran Trampoline Lacing Posts
Heavy-duty 3D-printed lacing posts designed for securing the trampoline on a catamaran. Built to withstand high lateral loads, these posts are compatible with M5 countersunk machine screws and feature a compact, low-profile mushroom shape.

- **Designed for M5 countersunk screws** – provides secure flush mounting  
- **Compact footprint** – fits deck contours without obstruction  
- **Rugged construction** – print with 100% infill to resist lateral loads  

## Print Settings

- **Material**: PETG or ASA recommended for outdoor durability  
- **Layer height**: 0.15 mm  
- **Infill**: 100%  
- **Supports**: None required
