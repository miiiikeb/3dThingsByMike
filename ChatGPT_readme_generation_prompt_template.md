Write a `readme.md` for a 3D model using the following structure and formatting. Format it in markdown. Use clear, concise language.

---

### üìå Structure:

**1. Title**  
`# [PROJECT NAME]`  
A one-line summary of what the object is, including its purpose and any standout features (e.g., ‚ÄúA compact travel case for the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons, with magnetic closure and a print-in-place hinge‚Äù).

**2. Images**  
Include up to 5 image blocks, formatted like this:  
[<img src="[IMAGE_URL]" width="300"/>]([IMAGE_LINK])  
Each should link to the full-size version.

**3. Features**  
A bulleted list highlighting key features of the design. Use bold for key terms. Example:
- **Print-in-place hinge** ‚Äì no assembly required  
- **Snaps closed with magnets** ‚Äì uses 4x 6mm x 2mm neodymium magnets  
- **Support-free print** ‚Äì prints flat on the bed  

**4. Print Settings**  
Include these subheadings:
- **Material**: [PLA, PETG, etc.]  
- **Layer height**: [e.g., 0.15 mm]  
- **Infill**: [e.g., 20%]  
- **Perimeters**: [e.g., 2]
- **Supports**: [None/Yes + notes]  
- **Brim**: [e.g., 5mm or None]  
- **Orientation**: [e.g., Print flat, hinge up, as shown]

**5. Assembly Instructions**  
List the steps to prepare the part post-print, including magnet insertion or hinge loosening. Example:
1. Gently flex the hinge to loosen it.  
2. Glue in magnets ‚Äî **check polarity first**.  
3. Test fit and functionality.

**6. Source**  
Include design software used and GitHub project link:
Designed in **[e.g., OpenSCAD]**  
GitHub: https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPO]/tree/main/[FOLDER]

**7. License**  
Standard wording:
